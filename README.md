Repository for SNHU Course CS-250-10304-M01 Software Development Lifecycle

Once you have submitted this artifact, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. These prompts are some of the “essential questions” for the Computer Science program. You will encounter these questions in different courses throughout the program. They are open-ended and meant to help you engage with “big ideas” in the field. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
