**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
To intereret the user's needs it is important to ask for the who, what and why of each request. This can then be developed into a user story as a sentence in the format "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]." By having these user stories, it provides an exact request to develop to meet the client's needs. This is important because it defines what is "done" without their being scope creep.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
After taking this course I have learned the how important it is to approach the development of a program with a clear objective. I used to know what I wanted, and would blindly code until I got there. In the future I will definitely use user stories for development to the final product. I currently only develop by myself, so in the view of Scrum, I will have to learn to encompass all roles.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
To be a good team member in software development requires the ability to communicate effectively. It is also required to be able to collaborate with others and work on the final product together. Finally, it is important to practice good coding techniques for other team members to know what you have done and how your code works.
